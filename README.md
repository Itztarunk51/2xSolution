Task 2: NFT Minting Smart Contract with Chain Flexibility
Create a smart contract for minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Choose a blockchain platform, such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana. The contract should enable NFT minting exclusively on a single blockchain network. Implement a whitelist (WL) wallet system in phases, allowing only specific wallet addresses to mint NFTs during the initial phase. Design functions to verify wallet addresses against the whitelist and grant minting privileges accordingly. Follow best practices, include error handling, and provide clear documentation.

Task 3: Odd and Even Game Contract
Develop a smart contract for an "Odd and Even" game. Participants should be able to place bets on whether a randomly generated number will be odd or even. The smart contract should handle the betting process, random number generation, and accurate distribution of winnings to the correct participants. Consider additional features such as betting limits, participation fees, and transparent outcome verification. Implement the contract on a blockchain platform of your choice, ensuring security and efficiency. Completing all three tasks will lead to direct selection, while successful completion of one or two tasks will qualify you for the interview round.
